This digital resume will serve as a dynamic representation of your skills, experiences, and accomplishments, enhancing your professional portfolio and increasing your visibility to potential employers or clients.

**Key Components:**

2. **CSS Styling:** Apply CSS styles to customize the appearance of the resume website, including fonts, colors, layout, spacing, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
3. **Content Sections:** Organize the resume content into sections such as introduction, education, experience, skills, projects, and contact information.
4. **Interactive Elements:** Incorporate interactive elements such as buttons, navigation menus, hover effects, and animations to engage visitors and create a memorable user experience.
5. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the resume website is accessible and looks visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

**Technology Used:**
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** Used to structure the content and layout of the resume website, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other elements.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Used to apply styles and formatting to HTML elements, including colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, and positioning.
- **CSS Frameworks (Optional):** Utilize CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Bulma to streamline the design process and ensure consistency and responsiveness.
- **Media Queries:** Employ media queries in CSS to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Version Control (Optional):** Use version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub to manage and collaborate on the project's codebase, track changes, and deploy updates.
